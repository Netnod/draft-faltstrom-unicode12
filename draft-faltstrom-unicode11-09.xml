	This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.2.0 and
	Unicode 12.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008.  Some additions and
	changes have been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the
	values produced by the algorithm IDNA2008 specifies. IDNA2008
	allows adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward
	compatibility; however, this document does not add any such
	exceptions. This document provides the necessary tables to
	IANA to make its database consisstent with Unicode 12.0.0.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The current version of Internationalized Domain Names for
	Applications (IDNA) was initiated in 2008, and despite not
	being completed until 2010, is widely known as "IDNA2008". It
	is specified in the series of documents listed in
	<xref target="idna2008"/>. The IDNA2008 standard includes an
	algorithm by which a derived property value is calculated
	based on the properties defined from the Unicode Standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	The derived property values that can be calculated are defined
	in <xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref>. The summary below
	is a summary to make the reading of this document easier. For
	definition of the terms, please see <xref target="RFC5892">RFC
	5892</xref>.
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs.
	    Code points with this property value are permitted for
	    general use in IDNs.  However, that a label consists only
	    of code points that have this property value does not
	    imply that the label can be used in DNS. The abbreviated
	    term PVALID is used to refer to this value.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED: Some characteristics of the
            character, such as it being invisible in certain contexts
            or problematic in others, require that it not be used in
            labels unless specific other characters or properties are
            present.  The abbreviated term CONTEXT is used to refer to
            this value.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    DISALLOWED: Those that should clearly not be included in
	    IDNs.  Code points with this property value are not
	    permitted in IDNs.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    UNASSIGNED: Those code points that are not designated (i.e., are
	    unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	When the Unicode Standard is updated, new code points are assigned
	and already-assigned code points can have their property values changed. 
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    Assigning code points can create problems if the
	    newly-assigned code points are compositions of existing
	    code points and because of that the normalization
	    relationships associated with those code points should
	    have been changed.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Changing properties for already-assigned code points can
	    create problems if the property change results in changes
	    to the derived property value. This might make an earlier
	    allowed code point whose derived property value is PVALID
	    to then not be allowed anymore if its derived property
	    value changes to DISALLOWED.  The problem can also happen
	    the other way around: a code point that was not allowed
	    (and thus is prohibited) can suddenly end up being
	    allowed.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Problems can also be created if the properties assigned to
	    those code points are inconsistent with IDNA2008
	    assumptions about how properties are assigned and/or about
	    how code points with those properties are used or behave.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	There were three incompatible changes in the Unicode standard
	after <xref target="Unicode-5.2.0">Unicode 5.2.0</xref> up to
	including <xref target="Unicode-6.0.0">Unicode 6.0.0</xref>,
	as described in <xref target="RFC6452">RFC 6452</xref>. The
	code points U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 had a derived property value
	change from DISALLOWED to PVALID while U+19DA had a change in
	derived property value from PVALID to DISALLOWED. They were
	examined in great detail and IETF concluded that the consensus
	is that no update was needed to <xref target="RFC5892">RFC
	5892</xref> based on the changes made to the Unicode standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	As described in <xref target="changes"/>, more changes have
	been made to code points between Unicode version 6.0.0 and
	<xref target="Unicode-12.0.0">Unicode version 12.0.0</xref> so
	that the derived property values have been changed in an
	incompatible way.  This document concludes that no exceptions
	are to be added to <xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref>
	even though there are changes in the derived property value as
	a result of the changes made in Unicode between version 6.2.0
	and 12.0.0.
      </t>
      <t>
	Further, in 2015, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
	issued <xref target="IAB">a statement</xref> which requested
	the IETF to resolve the issues related to the code point
	ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) that was
	introduced in <xref target="Unicode-7.0.0">Unicode
	7.0.0</xref>. This document concludes that this code point is
	not to be added to the exception list either. It should be
	noted that the review on U+08A1 indicated that it is not an
	isolated case and that a number of PVALID code points of long
	standing may have similar issues. The problem is described in
	more detail in a document in progress,
	<xref target="I-D.klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70">draft-klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70</xref>.
	A fuller resolution of this issue may require future changes
	to IDNA2008 or additional specifications, but there is
	insufficient understanding yet of what would constitute the
	best approach.

	  There are many variations on the general IDNA model in use
	  in the various parts of the community. The following lists
	  some of the strategies that implementations that claim to be
	  IDNA compliant are known to use, but it should be noted the
	  list is not complete:
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      IDNA2003 as specified in <xref target="RFC3490">RFC
	      3490</xref> and <xref target="RFC3491">RFC 3491</xref>.
	      Those specifications are dependent on case folding and
	      NFKC normalization and on tables that specify for each
	      code point whether it is allowed to be used or not, with
	      a distinction made between use for "stored strings" and
	      "query strings".  The tables themselves are dependent on
	      <xref target="Unicode-3.2.0">version 3.2 of The Unicode Standard</xref>.
	    </t>
	    <t>
              A number of variations on IDNA2003, sometimes presented
              as "updated IDNA2003" or the like, which follow the
              principles of IDNA2003 as understood by the implementers
              but that use tables that represent how the implementers
              believe <xref target="RFC3454">Stringprep</xref>
              and <xref target="RFC3491">Nameprep</xref> would have
              evolved had the IETF not moved in the direction of
              IDNA2008 instead.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 where code points
	      assigned to Unicode
	      after <xref target="Unicode-3.2.0">Unicode 3.2.0</xref>
	      have derived property value calculated according to the
	      algorithm specified in IDNA2008.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 according to
	      the <xref target="UTS-46">Unicode Technical Standard
	      #46</xref>.  Because that document specifies different
	      profiles, there are several different variations that
	      leave users with no guarantee that two applications
	      claiming conformance to UTS#46 will interoperate well
	      with each other much less with conforming IDNA2008
	      implementations.  UTS#46 is ultimately based on a
	      normative table very much like the one used by
	      <xref target="RFC3454">Stringprep</xref> but updated for
	      each new version of Unicode.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The (normative) IDNA2008 algorithm applied to whatever
	      version of Unicode Standard exists in the operating
	      system and/or libraries used, independent of whatever
	      version of tables appears in the (non-normative) IANA
	      detabase.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	  In practice, the Unicode Consortium creates a maximum set of
	  code points by assigning code points in the Unicode
	  Standard. The IDNA2008 rules use the Unicode Standard to
	  create a further subset of code points and context that are
	  permitted in DNS labels associated with its PVALID,
	  CONTEXTJ, and CONTEXTO derived property values. DNS
	  registries and other organizations that deal with IDNs are
	  supposed to create their own subsets from IDNA2008 for use
	  by those registries and organizations.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This progressing subsetting and narrowing of the repertoire
          of code points that can be used in labels is an
          implementation of the principles of being conservative when
          deciding what code points to include in such a subset.
	  <xref target="SAC-084">SAC-084</xref>
	  and <xref target="RFC6912">RFC 6912</xref> recommend to DNS
	  registries and other organizations to be conservative when

	  The character ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) was
	  introduced in Unicode 7.0.0. This was discussed extensively in the IETF,
	  and by the IAB in <xref target="IAB">their
	  statement</xref> requesting the IETF to investigate the
	  issue. Specifically, the IAB stated:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list>
	    <t>
	      On the same precautionary principle, the IAB recommends
	      that the Internationalized Domain Names for Applications
	      (IDNA) Parameters registry
	      (http://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/) not be
	      updated to Unicode 7.0.0 until the IETF has consensus on a
	      solution to this problem.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  The discussion in the IETF concluded that although it is
	  possible to create "the same" character in multiple ways,
	  the issue with U+08A1 is not unique.  The character U+08A1
	  (ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE) can be represented with
	  the sequence ARABIC LETTER BEH (U+0628) and ARABIC HAMZA
	  ABOVE (U+0654). This identical to LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH
	  STROKE (U+00F8), which can be represented with the sequence
	  LATIN SMALL LETTER O (U+006F) followed by COMBINING SHORT
	  SOLIDUS OVERLAY (U+0337).
	</t>
	<t>
	  Although the discussion about this specific code point
	  resulted in acceptance of the derived property value of
	  PVALID, the underlying problem with combining sequences is
	  not understood fully. Therefore it cannot be claimed that
	  this case can be extrapolated to other situtions and other
	  code points.

      <t>
	As one can see in <xref target="changes"/>, there is one incompatible
	change made between Unicode 6.2.0 and 12.0.0, the code point U+111C9.
	It has changed derived property value from DISALLOWED to PVALID. In
	situations like these, IDNA2008 allow for addition of rules to
	<xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref> section
	2.7. (BackwardCompatible (G)).  The code point if being
	accepted might due to implementations of IDNA2008 based on
	older versions of Unicode than 11.0.0 be rejected. As the
	character is rarely used outside of the group of Sharada
	specialists, and used in some records for indicating sandhi
	breaks, the conclusion is that it could either be added as an
	exception or allowed to change its property value, as the use
	of the code point is limited outside a special community. As
	including an exception would require implementation changes in
	deployed implementations of IDNA20008, the editor proposes
	that such a BackwardCompatible rule NOT to be added to
	IDNA2008.
      </t>
      <t>
	EDITOR PROPOSAL:
      </t>
      <t>
	The IETF has decided to NOT add a BackwardCompatible rule to IDNA2008 (i.e. Section 2.7 of <xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref>) for this code point.

    <section title="Conclusion">
      <t>
	As described in <xref target="changes"/> and
	<xref target="SHARADA"/>, changes have been made to Unicode
	between version 6.2.0 and 12.0.0. Some changes to specific
	characters changed their derived property value, whereas other
	changes did not.  Given the deployment considerations
	described in <xref target="deployment"/> and changes in the
	Unicode Standard described in <xref target="changes"/> and
	<xref target="SHARADA"/>, including implications to
	normalization, the conclusion of this document is to not add
	any exception rules to IDNA2008.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document addresses only changes to Unicode between
        version 6.2.0 and version 12.0.0.  Changes in future Unicode
        versions might result in the conclusion that exception rules
        need to be added to IDNA2008.  Separately from any changes in
        Unicode, the IETF might conclude that updates
        to <xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref> or other IDNA2008
        documents might become necessary; such updates might include
        changes to the algorithm specified in IDNA2008 as well as
        additional rules, categories, or other forms of tuning.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	IANA is requested to update the IDNA Parameters registry of
	derived property values, after the expert reviewer validates
	that the derived property values are calculated correctly.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	This document makes recommendations regarding the use of the
	IDNA2008 algorithm for calculation of derived property values,
	based on the Unicode version 12.0.0. This recommendation do not
	say anything about what recommendations to make for future
	versions of the Unicode Standard.
      </t>
      <t>
	Not following these recommendations can lead to various
	security issues. Specifically, allowing confusable characters
	may lead to various phishing attacks, as described in the Security
	Consideration Sections in the documents listed in section
	<xref target="idna2008"/>.
